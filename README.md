# COT-4500 Assignment 2

## Description

This repository contains solutions for COT-4500 Assignment 2, focusing on various polynomial interpolation techniques implemented in Python. The methods covered include:

- Neville's Method
- Newton's Forward Difference Method
- Hermite Interpolation
- Cubic Spline Interpolation

Each method is implemented with corresponding test cases to validate their functionality.


## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SamElomari/cot-4500-Pro2.git
   cd cot-4500-Pro2

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python installed on your system. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. To install the required packages, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

After installation, you can run the test suite to validate the implementations:

```bash
python src/test/test_assignment_2.py
```

This command will execute the test script, which in turn calls each interpolation function with predefined inputs and displays the results.
